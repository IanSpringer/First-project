War

War is a classic card game that pits two players against one another.
Two players (or a player and a computer) are each dealt 28 cards whose values
are associated to their rank in the deck (2 < 3, jack < king, ace has the highest value.)

Ideas

War must contain an object (or possibly an 2d array) of all 52 cards and their rank. For example a
2 of hearts will have a point value of 1. A jack's value will equal 10, queen: 11, king: 12,
and Ace: 13.

var deck = {
  2: 1;
  3: 2;
  4: 3
  ...
}

Next, the player and computer will need functions to recieve 28 randomly drawn cards from the deck, which will be listed in their own new array.

var userGetCard = function(){

};

var computerGetCard = function(
);

playerDeck = [];
computerDeck= []



A function will randomly pluck 1 card from each new array to be compared according to their values.

Next, a new function will compare the values of the cards to assign a winner for that draw. Each win will assign 1 point to either the player or computer. Should the draw result in 'war', the winner of war will be awardes 10 points.

var compareCards = function(){

}

Should the game go to "war", a new function will be called to assign five cards to each player from their respective arrays.

Next, we will need a variables to keep track of the points tallied by both the user and computer

var userPoints;
var computerPoints;

When all cards have been used, the player with the most points wins.
If userPoints>computerPoints, the user wins!

There will be another variable to store how many games have been won by each side. The first one to win 5 games is the champion!

FEATURES

The game will open with a button to start. Once the game starts, there will be another button to 'play' each hand. Should there be 'war',
a popup will appear saying "are you ready to go to war?"
