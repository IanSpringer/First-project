War

War is a classic card game that pits two players against one another. The idea is simple, but the stakes are high.

Each player is dealt 26 cards  from a standard 52 card deck. The players then begin drawing cards one at a time, at the same time.
Who ever has the higher card value wins that hand. Each winning hand is assigned 1 point to the players total points. the rank of cards
from weakest to strongest is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, jack, queen, king, ace.

Should the two cards of a draw be equal in rank, "war" has begun. In this case, two additional cards will be dealt each player, and the player with the highest ranking card of all
6 cards will win the battle, and awarded 10 points. The player with the most points when all 52 cards have been played wins.

The best of 5 games will be awarded the war champion.
